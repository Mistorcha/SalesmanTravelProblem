# SalesmanTravelProblem

The idea was to create with Python and Tkinter a example of Genetic algorithm to solve the Salesman Problem
Mostly it's my first real programm ever written and it's ugly as fuck, not easy to use, but it works pretty well :)


The file BruteForce was just there to give me an idea of how long it'd take to solve the problem using brut force and compare it to the genetic algorithm, it's useless and just for fun.

For the other file, I created it long time ago and I do not code in Python anymore so help yourself if you want to make it works.

Bisous,

Mistorcha
